      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <p>
              Demise is an old-school, dungeon-crawling RPG. Your goal is to explore the dungeon to find and defeat the 
              evil therein.
            </p>
            <p>
              In single player (SP) you can explore the dungeon with a group of up to four characters. These 
              characters are all created by you, and you have complete control over all of them. In multiplayer 
              (MP) you may only play one character at a time.
            </p>
            <p>By exploring and defeating monsters in the dungeon, your character(s) will become stronger and be able to
              take on more powerful monsters in the depths.
            </p>
            <p>
              A character may join up to twelve guilds (classes) in Demise and can be a member of more than one guild 
              at a time, but they can only gain experience in their currently active guild. They may switch their 
              active guild in town. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Each guild provides a different set of abilities and/or spells. Some specialise in combat (Warrior) while 
              others focus on learning many spells (Warlock), unlocking chests (Thief) or finding secrets and moving 
              safely though the dungeon (Explorer). Most guilds, have restrictions on what items members can use. The 
              Warlock guild, for example, will not allow their members to wear heavy armour.

          <h3>My First Character</h3>
          <p>
            The first few levels of the dungeon can be very dangerous for new adventurers. Your first character(s) will 
            be quite weak, since they start with few attributes and low hitpoints (HP). Your character will gain HP as they 
            level up, but will not gain attributes. These come in the form of tomes and potions, found in the dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is often recommended to start out with a tough fighter character who will have a much easier time in the first 
            few levels than most. It’s this character’s job to explore the first three levels of the dungeon and collect stat 
            boosting tomes and potions for your main character.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Race: Giant</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Class: Warrior</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Alignment: Neutral</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Stats: 14 Str, 10 Int, 10 Wis, 16 Con, 4 Cha, 12 Dex</strong></p>
          <p>
            Once you have collected a around 10 endurance potions or tomes it’s time to make your main character. 
            You can of course keep this character, the giant warrior is a powerful fighter and very durable - more than 
            capable of delving into the deepest depths of the dungeon.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Main Character Options</h3>
          <p>
            Here are some example characters that can compliment and add skills to the Giant fighter.
          </p>
          <p><strong>1. Elf Warlock (Artisan 1-30 -> Warlock 1-40+)</strong></p>
          <p>Good HP, Good A/D. Blasting/Movement/Resist Spells.</p>
          <p>
            The starting levels in Artisan are well worth it for a spellcaster, providing HP, A/D and early access to items making 
            leveling Warlock much, much easier. Warlocks learn a huge variety of spells to cover almost everything except Charming 
            and Healing.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Saris Thief (Artisan 1-30 -> Thief 1-30+)</strong></p>
          <p>Average HP, Best Disarming, poor Fighting.</p>
          <p>
            Starting levels in Artisan for HP & A/D. Thief for best disarming. The thieving and fighting skills of the Thief will 
            eventually surpass the Artisan, removing the XP penalty but keeping the bonus HP. Can open magically locked chests.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3. Dwarf Explorer (Artisan 1-30 -> Explorer 1-30+)</strong></p>
          <p>Average HP, Best Perception, Movement and Resist Spells.</p>
          <p>
            Again starting in Artisan for HP & A/D. Explorer for best perception and access to resist and movement spells such as Levitation 
            and Teleport.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Skills and Spells</h3>
          <p>No matter the class you choose, some of the most important skills for a party are:</p>
          <p><strong>Required</strong></p>
          <ul>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Movement Spells - Explorer, Warlock
              <ul>
                <li>teleport speeds up leveling, breathing & flight make the dungeon much safer</li>
              </ul>

        <h1 class="title">Party Size</h1>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <h3>Going Solo</h3>
            <p>
              A single character, in a single guild is the <strong>by far the fastest way to level.</strong> Less spell points are needed 
              to be used on healing and resistance spells, and a single character needs far fewer tomes/potions than a party of four to 
              maximise their stats. Companions are highly recommended for solo - dragons and spellcasters make the excellent companions to 
              help fight large groups of monsters.
            </p>
            <h3>Party Play</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike many modern games, in Demise <strong>experience is not shared</strong> between party members. 
              <strong>The only way for a character to gain experience is by damaging and killing monsters.</strong> Therefore, a party 
              of four will need four times as much total experience to level than a solo character and ensure each character is 
              contributing to the damage.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Parties can clear most rooms in fewer rounds, making exploration faster and safer. However, the party will often be 
              limited by the Attack/Defence rating of its weakest member since monsters will often attack the weakest party member. 
              Parties can also be clunky to play - targets of healing/buffs need to be selected manually each and every cast, and 
              you’ll need to frequently re-arrange your party order to ensure that each character is gaining enough experience and 
              one isn’t taking all the kills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Slot 1 Spellcaster Bug:</strong> In versions of Demise previous to Revenge, any damaging spell cast from party 
              slots 2, 3 or 4 (not the left-most slot) will hit significantly fewer monsters than they are supposed to. Usually damaging 
              less than half of the total monsters that it otherwise should. To get around this, the spellcaster needs to be in slot 1 when 
              casting offensive spells. <strong>This bug has since been fixed in Revenge of the Tavern Keeper.</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Can't it Be Both?</h3>
            <p>
              Perhaps the best compromise then, is with a party of two. This has the benefit of twice as much offensive power per round than 
              a solo character, with only minimal party management. When one character dies, the other can carry their body back to the 
              morgue for resurrection rather than wait for rescue. Finally, you have two destinations for Mystic Portal rather than one.

          <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <h3>Maximising Hit Points</h3>
            <p>
              Hit points are vital for survival in Demise and large portion of a characters hit points will be gained <strong>within the 
              first 30 character levels</strong>. So, a little planning at the start will make your character much more survivable 
              in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is affected by their current guild and Constitution. Warriors gain the most hits-per-level on average, followed by Artisan 
              and Paladin. Maxing out Constitution at level 1 is highly recommended as this can mean twice as many hit points at level 30. 
              After reaching the MxLv (most guilds around level 25) a character only gains 2hp per level. The extra 100-200 hit points can 
              make quite a difference to survivability in the dungeon, especially early on.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>To maximise Hit Points:</strong> Choose a martial guild (rather than a spellcaster) for the first character levels and ensure 
              constitution is at maximum for your race at level 1. If playing a spellcaster, or a low HP guild, choose Artisan first then switch guilds 
              after level 30 Artisan is reached. Outlined below:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Maximum HP:</strong> Warrior(26) -> Artisan (30) -> Warlock (38) -> <i>main guild</i> </br>
              <strong>Recommended HP:</strong> Artisan (30) -> <i>main guild</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              If playing solo, you might choose to take the maximum route as HP are invaluable. If playing in a party, where XP gains will be slower, 
              I like to take the recommended route only on any spellcasters (warlock, magi, sorcerer, cleric) and thief these guilds gain few HP/level and 
              have low A/D. To simplify: Take Artisan (30) if not starting as a warrior.
            </p>
            <h3>Attack/Defence Rating</h3>
            <p>
              Your Attack/Defence rating determines your ability to hit monsters and avoid being hit in return. Since 
              <strong>a single hit can instantly kill your character</strong>, Attack/Defence ratings are very important. Character level also affects 
              the chance a monster will inflict status effects, such as Poison, Disease, Paralysis or Stone. A high character level and high A/D will 
              make your character nearly untouchable.
            </p>
            <h3>Resistances</h3>
            <p>
              Resistances directly reduce the damage taken by abilities or spells and lower the chances of being affected by status effects. Since 
              spells and monster abilities (such as fire breath and acid spit) cannot miss, resistances are needed to survive these attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note only the highest source of a particular resistance is counted. If a character has 50% natural fire resistance and equips an item that 
              grants 30% fire resistance, that character's total fire resistance will be the highest modifier (50%).
            </p>
            <h3>Run Away</h3>
              <p> 
                <i>"The best defense is not being there" - Sensei.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Many monsters can inflict deadly status effects which can deal large amounts of damage, instantly kill or permanently drain attributes 
                and hit points. <strong>Particularly Dangerous Monster Types:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Slimes: Spit Acid, Corrode
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mythical Beasts: Stone
                </li>
                <li>
                  Undead: Drain, Paralyse
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It is advised to run from these monster types when encountered, until you have high resistance (at least 50%, ideally 90%), and enough 
                defence and character levels to avoid being hit.
              </p>

            <h3>Item Restrictions</h3>
            <p><strong>(Class Restricted)</strong> The character must meet the guild and level requirements in the active guild to use or equip that item.</p>
            <p><strong>(Not Class Restricted)</strong> May be used or equipped as long as the character has met the guild and level requirements previously. 
              Notably, Rings, Amulets and Daggers are Not Class Restricted, meaning that a level 10 Artisan can still equip the Dagger of Stealth if they 
              switch guilds to a level 1 Warlock.

              Monsters will occasionally ask to join your party. Press ‘J’ to accept the request. Alternatively, you can force monsters to join though 
              Charm spells - learned through the Magi guild or found on items. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Companions are very useful allies in Demise and can be considered mandatory when playing solo. Companions can take hits for you, kill 
              monsters for you or at least keep them occupied if you get paralysed. Many companions have special attacks that can kill large groups of 
              monsters, or instantly kill a single enemy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You only earn about 25-30% of the experience when companions damage/kill monsters, so companions are best used to ‘finish off’ rooms that 
              your character (or party) isn’t able to deal with in a single combat round. This way you can kill most monsters before they even get a 
              chance to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tips when using companions:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Keep the party size to 6 or less. Any more than this and companions may ‘accidentally’ attack other party members. Typically, 
                does not happen solo.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep companions healed. Just like characters, companions fight better when they have high HP.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep companion bind level up. Companions may leave if their bind level drops too low.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beware of Fright traps! These force companions to leave.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try not to die. Companions leave when you die.
              </li>
              <li>
                The spell ‘Life Domination’ permanently binds a companion to you. Their bind level cannot drop.
